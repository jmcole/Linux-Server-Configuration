# Linux Server Configuration

## Project Overview



The purpose of this project was to:
> take a baseline installation of a Linux server and prepare it to host your web applications. You will secure your server from a number of attack vectors, install and configure a database server, and deploy one of your existing web applications onto it

[Udacity Project Overview](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd004/parts/ab002e9a-b26c-43a4-8460-dc4c4b11c379/modules/357367901175462/lessons/3573679011239847/concepts/36124987540923)

This project required the deployment of the previously created "Catalog" project and deploy it on AWS Lightsail Ubuntu Server. In addition, security measures were implemented to harden the server against common attacks.

### Flora Catalog Web Application

Server IP Address - 18.220.144.46

SSH Port - 2200

URL - http://ec2-18-220-144-46.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com

### Application Functionality

This application is setup to serve the Floral Catalog website on port 80. It uses a Postgresql database and properly functions as designed. In addition, it uses Google for authentication to enable adds, edits, and deletes the website data.

### Major Software Installed

Web Server: Apache2 - [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-the-apache-web-server-on-ubuntu-16-04)
Database Management: Postgresql - [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-and-use-postgresql-on-ubuntu-16-04)
Web Framework: Flask - [Profit Bricks](https://devops.profitbricks.com/tutorials/deploy-a-flask-application-on-ubuntu-1404/)

Git was installed in order to clone the Catalog project.

In addition, many packages were installed in order for the project.py(later changed to __init__.py) application to run. Such as, SQL Alchemy, httplib2, and oauth2client.
